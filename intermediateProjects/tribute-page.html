                  Aristotle was an ancient Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece.
                 His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age,
                 he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven. His writings cover many subjects – including physics, biology,
                 zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government –
                 and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and,
                 at the request of Philip II of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC.

              <p class="text-center">
                Teaching Alexander the Great gave Aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies. He established a library in the Lyceum which aided in the
                production of many of his hundreds of books, which were written on papyrus scrolls. The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his
                former views of Platonism, but, following Plato's death, Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to empiricism.
                He believed all peoples' concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on perception. Aristotle's views on natural sciences represent the
                groundwork underlying many of his works.

              <h3><em>Aristotle's famous quote:</em></h3>
              <blockquote cite="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aristotle">
                <p class="text-center">
                  The bodies of which the world is composed are solids, and therefore have three dimensions. Now, three is the most perfect number,
                  —it is the first of numbers, for of one we do not speak as a number, of two we say both, but three is the first number of which we say all.
                  Moreover, it has a beginning, a middle, and an end.
                </p>
